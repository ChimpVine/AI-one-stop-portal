This means there are 12 apples in total.</p><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> <br/> <ul><li>Mathematics: Multiplication is foundational for learning division, fractions, and more complex math concepts.</li><li>Real-world applications: Used in budgeting, cooking, and measuring distances.</li></ul></p>",
