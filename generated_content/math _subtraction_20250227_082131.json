The result of subtraction is called the <strong>difference</strong>.</p><p>For example: In the equation 10 - 3 = 7, 10 is the minuend, 3 is the subtrahend, and 7 is the difference.</p><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> <br/> <ul><li>Mathematics: Understanding subtraction is fundamental for all arithmetic operations.</li><li>Real-world applications: Used in budgeting, measuring distances, and calculating time.</li></ul></p>",
