These interactions create a balance that supports life.</p><p><strong>Key Components:</strong> <br/> <ul><li><strong>Biotic Factors:</strong> All living things in an ecosystem, such as plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria.</li><li><strong>Abiotic Factors:</strong> Non-living elements like sunlight, water, temperature, and minerals.</li></ul></p>",
    "login_article_historical_context_or_origin": "<p>The concept of ecosystems was first introduced in the early 20th century by British ecologist Arthur Tansley. He emphasized the importance of the interactions between organisms and their environment, which laid the groundwork for modern ecology.</p>",
    "login_article_understanding_the_problem": "<p>To understand ecosystems, we need to explore how different components work together. For example, consider a forest ecosystem: <br> <li>Plants (like trees) produce oxygen and food through photosynthesis.</li><li>Animals (like deer) depend on plants for food and shelter.</li><li>Decomposers (like fungi) break down dead organisms, returning nutrients to the soil.</li></p>",
