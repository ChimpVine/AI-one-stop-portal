        <h3><strong>What are Even and Odd Numbers?</strong></h3>

        <p><strong>Even numbers:</strong> Even numbers are whole numbers that can be perfectly divided by 2 with no remainder. Examples of even numbers include 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on.</p>

        <p><strong>Odd numbers:</strong> Odd numbers are whole numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Examples of odd numbers include 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on.</p>

        <h3><strong>Properties of Even and Odd Numbers</strong></h3>

        <h4><strong>Even Numbers:</strong></h4>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Divisible by 2:</strong> Even numbers are those that can be divided by 2 with no remainder.</li>
        <li><strong>Ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8:</strong> The last digit of even numbers is always 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>Odd Numbers:</strong></h4>

        <ul>

        <h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</strong></h2>

        <h3><strong>Are there any numbers that are neither even nor odd?</strong></h3>

        <p>No, whole numbers are classified as either even or odd. Zero is a special case; it’s considered neither even nor odd by some mathematicians, while others consider it to be even because it’s divisible by 2.</p>

        <h3><strong>How can I identify even and odd numbers quickly when dealing with large numbers?</strong></h3>

        <p>For larger numbers, divisibility by 2 can be cumbersome. Here’s a trick: a number is even if the last two digits are divisible by 4. For example, 1256 is even because the last two digits (56) are divisible by 4 (14).</p>

        <h3><strong>How are even and odd numbers used in advanced mathematics?</strong></h3>

        <p>Even and odd properties play a crucial role in concepts like parity checks (used in error detection in data transmission), modular arithmetic (a system of clock-like arithmetic), and identification of prime numbers (numbers divisible by only 1 and itself).</p>
