        <h4>What is LCM?:</h4>
        When dealing with numbers, especially in mathematics, you often come across the term "Least Common Multiple" or LCM. But what exactly does it mean? Let's dive into the world of LCM and understand its significance in solving mathematical problems.

        <h2>Definition</h2>

        <h4>The LCM Explained: </h4>
        The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest multiple that is exactly divisible by each of the numbers. In simpler terms, it is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the given numbers.

        <h2>Methods </h2>

        <h4>Finding the LCM: </h34>
        There are various methods to find the LCM of numbers. One common method is to list the multiples of each number and find the smallest multiple that is common to all the numbers. Another method involves using prime factorization to find the LCM.

        <h2>Example</h2>

        <h4>Finding the LCM of 12 and 15:</h4>
        <strong> Step 1: </strong> List the multiples of each number
        Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, ...
        Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, ...
        <strong> Step 2: </strong> Identify the smallest common multiple
        The smallest common multiple of 12 and 15 is 60.
        So, the LCM of 12 and 15 is 60.

        <h2>Real-Life Applications</h2>

        <strong>Story: "The LCM Adventure of Alex and Lily"</strong>
        Alex and Lily were two adventurous siblings who loved solving puzzles and riddles. One day, they encountered a series of challenges that required them to use the concept of LCM to overcome obstacles and complete their quests.

        <strong>Challenge 1: The Treasure Hunt</strong>
        Alex and Lily embarked on a treasure hunt that led them to a mysterious cave. Inside the cave, they found a locked chest with a riddle written on it. The riddle stated, "To open the chest, find the least number that is a multiple of 4, 6, and 8." Remembering their lessons on LCM, Alex and Lily quickly calculated the LCM of 4, 6, and 8, which turned out to be 24. They used the number to unlock the chest and discovered a map to the hidden treasure.

        <strong>Challenge 2: The Magical Bridge</strong>
        As they continued their adventure, Alex and Lily encountered a magical bridge guarded by a mystical creature. The creature challenged them to find the least number of steps that would cause the bridge to light up. The steps were numbered 5, 7, and 9. Applying their knowledge of LCM, Alex and Lily calculated the LCM of 5, 7, and 9, which turned out to be 315. As they took 315 steps, the bridge lit up, allowing them to cross safely.

        <strong>Challenge 3: The Enchanted Garden</strong>
        In the final challenge, Alex and Lily entered an enchanted garden filled with beautiful flowers. They were tasked with arranging the flowers in rows, with each row containing 12, 15, and 18 flowers. Using the concept of LCM, they determined that they needed 180 flowers to fill each row without any flowers left over. The garden bloomed with vibrant colors, and the siblings completed their adventure successfully.
